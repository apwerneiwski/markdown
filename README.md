# Markdown Submission
*This file was created as a submission to the first checkpoint of the Bloc Designer Track.*

### Below is a table containing what comes naturally to me in Markdown Syntax and what I need to improve on:

Naturally Easy  | Needs Improvement
------------ | -------------
**bolding** and *italicizing* text | Syntax highlighting
Numbered Lists<br/> 1. One<br/> 2. Two<br/> 3. Three | Task Lists and where/how/why they're used
Unordered Lists<br/> * Bullet Points<br/> * Dashes | SHA references
Images<br/> ![Github Logo](https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/25/25231.svg)| Issue Reference
Links<br/> [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/)| Basically all of the code used in Git and how to even use Github.<br/> Git and Github is brand new to me and I've been watching and reading numerous tutorials to try and wrap my head around it. :persevere:
All the different headers|
